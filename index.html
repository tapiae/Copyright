    Copyrights are given for the purpose of allowing a person to create and innovate their idea and make money on it without other people trying to plagiarize their idea.
    Copyrights are intended to protect owners right by not allowing people to recreate their idea and make money off of it, as if it was their own.
    Many things have copyrights such as movies,books,pictures,artwork and more.So copyrights is a good thing because it allows people to be innovative and creative
    without them having to worry about their idea getting stolen.These rights let there be more creative thinking becasue if one of their ideas is already someone elses
    then they have to think of a new idea that is original and has not been used otherwise they will be taking someone idea.
